~~This project is no longer maintained~~
I have forked the ANR Deckbuilder Android app to provide occasional updates to the rotation and cycles.
For the moment, I have no plan to develop new features but that may change.

# Deck Builder for Netrunner #
* Allows to build decks for both Corporation and Runner
* Ability to display only the data packs you own - makes cards searching easier
* Search through the cards collection to find what you need
* Can view all the cards in your deck in fullscreen mode
* Ability to display cards per data packs
* Cache all images for offline viewing
* Cards and images can be updated via NetrunnerDB
* Import OCTGN files directly in the application
* Export your files into OCTGN

# PERMISSIONS #
* Internet: Download cards and images
* Read External Storage: Required to import deck file

# DOWNLOAD #
~~[Get the application on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shuneault.netrunnerdeckbuilder)~~

***Time marches on, and so do Google dev policies that mean this app is no longer available on the Play store***

I am investigating whether there is a way to get the app onto Play or some other store but for now am limited to providing as an APK. Check in #jnet-nrdb-cobra on GLC for details.
